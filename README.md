# Task-Management
This is to manage the tasks for all the employees

## Environment Variables

To enable email functionality, you need to configure the following environment variables:

-   `BREVO_API_KEY`: Your API key from Brevo (formerly Sendinblue).
-   `BREVO_SENDER_EMAIL`: The email address you want to use as the sender for all outgoing emails (e.g., `no-reply@yourdomain.com`).

You can set these in a `.env.local` file for local development or in your deployment platform's environment settings (e.g., Vercel).
